# Overview

This is a simple command-line utility written in Rust to encrypt and decrypt text files with the ROT13 cryptographic algorithm.

I wrote this software to learn the basics of Rust.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code 1.88.1 as my IDE for this project.

I used Rust 1.77.2 to create this project.

# Useful Websites

- [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)

# Future Work

- Add in support for other cryptographic algorithms.
- Following the above, add CLI option to choose between encrypting/decrypting.
- Restructure code so files are read line-by-line instead of being loaded into memory all at once.
- Following the above, implement a progress bar to show progress of the encryption/decryption.
